# Simple Wallet API

## What the Code Does

This Node.js application creates a simple API server that provides information about cryptocurrency wallets. It offers two main endpoints:

1. `/wallet/:address/balances`: Returns the balances of USDC, USDT, and ETH for a given wallet address.
2. `/wallet/:address/transferVolume`: Returns the total transfer volume of USDC, USDT, and ETH in the past 24 hours for a given wallet address.

The server uses Express.js to handle HTTP requests and responses. It currently uses mock data stored in memory to simulate wallet information.

## Assumptions

1. The data is static and stored in memory, not fetched from a real blockchain or database.
2. There's only one wallet address hardcoded into the system.
3. The server runs on localhost:3000.
4. There's no authentication or authorization implemented.
5. The transfer history is limited and doesn't account for real-time updates.
6. The code assumes a simple structure for wallet data, including balances and transfers.

## How It Could Be Improved

1. **Real Data Integration**: Connect to actual blockchain nodes or APIs to fetch real-time data.
2. **Database Implementation**: Use a database to store wallet information persistently.
3. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication and authorization for API access.
4. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling and input validation.
5. **Scalability**: Implement caching and optimize data retrieval for better performance.
6. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests to ensure reliability.
7. **Documentation**: Implement API documentation using tools like Swagger.
8. **Logging**: Add proper logging for monitoring and debugging.
9. **Configuration**: Use environment variables for configuration settings.
10. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.

## How to Improve It

1. **Real Data Integration**:

   - Use libraries like `web3.js` or `ethers.js` to interact with Ethereum nodes.
   - Implement functions to fetch real-time balance and transaction data.

2. **Database Implementation**:

   - Use a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
   - Implement data models and database queries to replace in-memory storage.

3. **Authentication**:

   - Use middleware like Passport.js for authentication.
   - Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure API access.

4. **Error Handling**:

   - Create custom error classes.
   - Implement try-catch blocks in route handlers.
   - Use middleware for centralized error handling.

5. **Scalability**:

   - Implement Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
   - Use worker threads or clustering to handle more requests.

6. **Testing**:

   - Use testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha.
   - Write unit tests for individual functions and integration tests for API endpoints.

7. **Documentation**:

   - Use Swagger or OpenAPI to document the API endpoints.
   - Implement inline code documentation using JSDoc.

8. **Logging**:

   - Implement a logging library like Winston or Bunyan.
   - Set up different log levels for development and production environments.

9. **Configuration**:

   - Use `dotenv` to manage environment variables.
   - Create separate configuration files for different environments.

10. **Rate Limiting**:
    - Use middleware like `express-rate-limit` to implement rate limiting.
    - Set up different limits for authenticated and unauthenticated users.

By implementing these improvements, you can transform this simple API into a more robust, scalable, and production-ready service.
